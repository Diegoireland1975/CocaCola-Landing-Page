# CocaCola-Landing-Page
CocaCola Landing Page Clone
I tried to make a clone of the landing page of CocaCola
I used pure JS for the toggle for the hambuger menu
I used a library called SwiperJS for the slider of the items in the showcase.
This is a library I did not know, it's easy to use and you can add
very nice slide effects for an image gallery.
I used Css Flexbox mainly for all the Layout, except for the part with more drinks just before the Footer, where I used the Grid system
Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, JS, SwiperJS, FlexBox, Grid
